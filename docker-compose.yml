      # Pinning-by-digest is best practice because
      #
      #    Tags are mutable, so there is no guarantee a tag will never change.
      #    It guarantees that every instance of the service is running exactly the same code.
      #    It allows you to put an image through QA/testing and verify that that version of the image is approved to go into production.
      #    You can use Docker Content Trust and sign specific versions of the image.
      #    You can roll back to an earlier version of the image, even if that version was not tagged (or "no longer tagged").
      #    Digests also prevent race-conditions; if a new image is pushed while a deploy is in progress,
      #    different nodes may be pulling the images at different times, so some nodes have the new image, some have the old one.
